# Employee App (Flutter)

Minimal scaffold for the employee labeling app.

This directory contains `lib/` and a `pubspec.yaml` but is not a fully-initialized Flutter project. Use the repository bootstrap script to create platform folders and run dependency installation:

```bash
chmod +x ./scripts/bootstrap_flutter.sh
./scripts/bootstrap_flutter.sh
```

Then run the app in an emulator or device:

```bash
cd flutter/employee_app
flutter run
```

On Android emulators, use `http://10.0.2.2:5000` to reach a backend running on the host machine.
